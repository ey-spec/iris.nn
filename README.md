Neural Network from Scratch â€“ Iris Dataset
Overview
This project implements a basic feedforward neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy to classify iris flower species. It was built without using machine learning frameworks to better understand the internal mechanics of neural networks.

Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Features
Manual implementation of forward propagation

Sigmoid activation function

Loss calculation using Mean Squared Error

Weight updates using gradient descent

Trained and tested on the Iris dataset

Final model evaluated using classification accuracy

Motivation
The purpose of this project was to develop a deeper understanding of how neural networks work at a fundamental level by building one from the ground up without relying on high-level ML libraries.
